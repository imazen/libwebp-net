# libwebp wrapper for .NET

NOTICE: Do NOT use versions of Google's libwebp prior to 1.3.2! 

this project is not maintained; please use [Imageflow.Net](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow) instead to work with webp images. Imageflow is continually updated and secured, and bundles libwebp.

Build status for branch 'master': ![build status](http://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/imazen/libwebp-net.svg)
Last nuget release: ![Nuget release version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Imazen.WebP.svg)

This library is available on Nuget as [Imazen.WebP](http://nuget.org/packages/Imazen.WebP).

This library offers P/Invoke exposure for webp/decode.h and webp/encode.h, but not demux.h and mux.h.

## Key APIs

* `new Imazen.WebP.SimpleDecoder().DecodeFromBytes(byte[] data, long length)` -> `System.Drawing.Bitmap`
* `new Imazen.WebP.SimpleEncoder().Encode(Bitmap from, Stream to, float quality)`
* `Imazen.WebP.SimpleEncoder.GetEncoderVersion() -> String`, `Imazen.WebP.SimpleDecoder.GetDecoderVersion() -> String`

## Improvements we're very interested in

* Expose the power of Imazen.WebP.Extern.WebPConfig and Imazen.WebP.Extern.WebPPreset for better encoding. 
* Consider using WebPDecode for better decode error details. 
* Animation support
* Make LoadLibrary cross-platform (although it is not strictly neccessary)
* Add .NET Core support. This will likely require introducing a PixelBuffer{width, height, ptr, stride} interface that can wrap System.Drawing.Bitmap via adapter. System.Drawing.Bitmap is currently directly used by the `SimpleDecoder` and `SimpleEncoder` classes, but these total < 200 lines of code. Or, leave the core API as P/Invoke only. libwebp doesn't have a bad API at all. 

This library is binary compatible with as-is NMake builds of libwebp (no custom C/C++).
